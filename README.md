# Video-Frame-Processing
Using Python CV2 to save frames from a video or reconstruct a video from frames

Let's face it, most of the code for this that's out there is either really complicated or doesn't work.
Here's a simple implementation that does the job.

- read_frames.py ⇒ read frames from video and save to file
- write_frames.py ⇒ read images from directory and save to video

**Note:** frames must be named 0.png, 1.png, etc. or 0.jpg, 1.jpg, etc.
